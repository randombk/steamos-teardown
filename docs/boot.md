# Booting SteamOS

The SteamOS boot process is a three-staged UEFI affair.

## Stage 1: Steam Chainloader

The first EFI entrypoint is located in `/dev/vda1`, which is responsible for chaining to the configured A/B image and maintaining some basic stats about how often each image was booted.

The contents of this boot partition is very simple:

```
/dev/vda1
├── [2.0K]  efi
│   ├── [2.0K]  boot
│   │   ├── [123K]  bootx64.efi         => Initial EFI boot image
│   │   └── [   0]  steamcl-restricted  => Empty 'flag file', tells the chainloader not to check other devices for SteamOS images
│   └── [2.0K]  steamos
│       ├── [123K]  steamcl.efi         => Same file as 'bootx64.efi' above
│       ├── [   0]  steamcl-restricted  => Same flag file as above
│       ├── [  76]  steamcl-version     => Simple version string plus the SHA256 of 'bootx64.efi'
│       └── [897K]  steamos-bootconf    => Identical to `/usr/bin/steamos-bootconf`
└── [2.0K]  SteamOS
    └── [2.0K]  conf
        ├── [ 233]  A.conf  => bootconf file for Image A
        └── [ 296]  B.conf  => bootconf file for Image B
```

The files `A.conf` and `B.conf` are known internally to the chainloader as bootconf files. The information provided in them helps the chainloader determine which image to boot. Specifically, the chainloader sorts all bootconf files oldest to newest based on the `boot-requested-at` entry in each bootconf that contains datestamps (formatted `YYYYmmDDHHMMSS`). If `image-invalid` is set, indicating that the image is damaged, the bootconf is considered older than any bootconf that doesn't have it set, reducing its priority in boot.

Then each bootconf is looped through starting with the newest first. If `boot-other` is set, the bootconf is skipped, if not, then it's chosen to boot.

The bootconf files are used in part to handle [rollback logic in the case of a failed update](system-updates.md#32-rauc-bootloader-backend). An example contents of `B.conf` is as follows:

```
boot-requested-at: 0
boot-other: 0
boot-other-disabled: 0
boot-attempts: 0
boot-count: 8
boot-time: 20220728043451
image-invalid: 0
update: 0
update-disabled: 0
update-window-start: 0
update-window-end: 0
loader: 
partitions: 
title: B
comment: [2022-07-27 21:34:51 -0700] bootconf mode: boot-ok
```

## Stage 2: GRUB

The stage 2 EFI image is specific to each image, and is located at `/dev/vda2` (A) and `/dev/vda3` (B). The files here are generated via `/usr/bin/grub-mkimage`. This stage contains grub and little else:

```
/dev/vda2
├── [2.0K]  EFI
│   └── [2.0K]  steamos
│       ├── [5.5K]  grub.cfg        => GRUB configuration
│       └── [656K]  grubx64.efi     => GRUB EFI image
└── [2.0K]  SteamOS
    └── [2.0K]  partsets            => Text files containing disk UUIDs
        ├── [ 126]  A
        ├── [ 347]  all
        ├── [ 126]  B
        ├── [ 126]  other
        ├── [ 126]  self
        └── [  83]  shared
```

The grub config is mostly standard and contains a single boot option (The 'Advanced Options' menu is the exact same as the main entry):

```
menuentry 'SteamOS' --class steamos --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-simple-293b8cff-e33d-4aad-9385-d4be2891df75' {
	recordfail
	load_video
	gfxmode $linux_gfx_mode
	insmod steamenv
	insmod gzio
	if [ x$grub_platform = xxen ]; then insmod xzio; insmod lzopio; fi
	insmod part_gpt
	insmod btrfs
	search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 293b8cff-e33d-4aad-9385-d4be2891df75
	steamenv_boot	linux /boot/vmlinuz-linux-neptune console=tty1 rd.luks=0 rd.lvm=0 rd.md=0 rd.dm=0 rd.systemd.gpt_auto=no loglevel=3 quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles module_blacklist=tpm amd_iommu=off amdgpu.gttsize=8128 spi_amd.speed_dev=1 audit=0 fbcon=vc:4-6 fbcon=rotate:1
	initrd	/boot/amd-ucode.img /boot/initramfs-linux-neptune.img
}
```

One interesting note is the `steamenv_boot` command, which is a non-standard extension presumably implemented directly inside `grubx64.efi`.

The files in the `SteamOS/partsets` directory contain the disk partition UUIDs for each partition. How these are used during boot is unknown, but they are used in numerous system utilities such as during updates. For instance, the `all` file contains:

```
esp 910fa777-03cd-7142-9f3f-bead6d122f49
efi-A 2702b34c-84c1-ec4c-af28-a4cff0c23bf9
efi-B 2a97b5d2-7392-774a-a168-1429b98e7982
rootfs-A eac2d34a-cd2e-354e-ac0a-6e6121ed8535

var-B 0357eecb-944b-c446-b76b-3781832d918c
home 997a28d3-92e9-8b41-ab97-72b9bdb55386
```

## Stage 3: Linux Kernel

At last, we get to boot the Linux kernel itself. The `initramfs` and kernel image is stored on `/boot` on the root partition. There's a symlink `/boot/efi => /efi` linking to the Stage 2 GRUB partition of the selected A/B image.

* Initramfs path: `/boot/initramfs-linux-neptune.img`
* Kernel path: `/boot/vmlinuz-linux-neptune`

Initramfs contains the following hooks (configured at `/etc/ostree-mkinitcpio.conf`):

```
HOOKS="base systemd ostree autodetect modconf block filesystems keyboard fsck"
```
